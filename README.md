# opencv-for-fun

I made these projects for fun in the endsem break.

<b>Eye filter- </b>
Snapchat like eye filter using opencv and mediapipe.
I have got the basic version of this done but still needs a lot of improvement eg-the eyes should rotate with the face, better way to judge blinking is required.

<b>Catching the ball-</b>
This one has only been started. The end goal is to make a AR type game where one player can throw a "ball" and the other can catch it.</n>

Hopefully, I ll continue them.ðŸ˜„
